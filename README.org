#+TITLE: Implementing group chat with mizudroid and asterisk.

* Dependencies

** Server

Install the asterisk server and asterisk pjsip module or use FreePBX.
You can find instructions at https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Installing+Asterisk.

** Client

You should use a client that has sms capability, e.g. Mizudroid for Android:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mizuvoip.mizudroid.app&hl=en_US.

* Setup

** Server

Clone this repository

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Korbachev55/Industrial-training-Group-3-1.git
#+END_SRC

Go to the asterisk configuration directory, backup your files and copy
the files to your asterisk configuration directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# cd /etc/asterisk
# mv extensions.conf extensions.conf.backup
# mv pjsip.conf pjsip.conf.backup
# cp /path/to/thisrepo/*.conf ./
#+END_SRC

This configuration comes with three preconfigured users: Test1, Test2
and Test3.  The users are setup in the pjsip.conf file:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[test1](endpoint_internal)
auth=test1
aors=test1
[test1](auth_userpass)
password=test1
username=test1
[test1](aor_dynamic)
#+END_SRC

This sets up a user named "Test1" with password "Test1". To add more
users simply copy this section and change "Test1".

If you want to connect through a public ip, forward the ports 5060 and
10001-20000.

** Client
